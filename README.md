# HairSerumLab

Welcome to **HairSerumLab** – a comprehensive project repository for developing a custom hair serum. This project documents every stage of research, formulation, and testing to create an optimized hair care product.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a scientifically-backed hair serum using both organic and inorganic ingredients, leveraging rigorous research and testing to achieve optimal results.

**Approach:**  
- **Research:** In-depth study of ingredients, their properties, and potential synergistic effects.
- **Formulation:** Iterative experimentation by combining base oils (e.g., coconut oil) with essential oils (e.g., lavender) and active compounds (e.g., vitamin E).
- **Testing:** Detailed recording of each formulation’s performance, stability, and overall effectiveness.
- **Documentation:** Every step from ingredient sourcing to final testing is logged and version-controlled.
